Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
============================

Starlite includes a :class:`dto.Factory <starlite.dto.Factory>` class that allows you to create DTOs from pydantic models,
dataclasses, :class:`typing.TypedDict`, and any other class supported via plugins.

An instance of the factory must first be created, optionally passing plugins to it as a kwarg. It can then be used to
create a :class:`DTO <starlite.dto.DTO>` by calling the instance like a function. Additionally, it can exclude (drop)
attributes, remap field names and field types, and add new fields.

The created :class:`DTO <starlite.dto.DTO>` can be used for data parsing, validation and OpenAPI schema generation like a
regularly declared pydantic model.

.. attention::

    Although the value generated is a pydantic factory, because it is being generated programmatically, it's
    currently impossible to extend editor auto-complete for the DTO properties - it will be typed as `DTO[T]`,
    with T being a generic argument representing the original model used to create the DTO.

.. note::

    MyPy doesn't support using types defined using `Type[]` as a type, and MyPy will regard these as invalid types.
    There is currently no way to circumvent this (not even with a plugin) except using a # type: ignore comment.

The :class:`Factory <starlite.dto.Factory>` class supports :doc:`plugins </usage/plugins/index>`, for example, this
is how it could be used with an SQLAlchemy declarative class using the
:doc:`SQLAlchemyPlugin </usage/plugins/sqlalchemy>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/data_transfer_objects/dto_basic.py
    :caption: Declaring a DTO
    :language: python


The created ``CompanyDTO`` is equal to this pydantic model declaration:

.. code-block:: python

   from pydantic import BaseModel


   class CompanyDTO(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       worth: float

You can now use it in route handler functions as you would any other pydantic model. The one caveat though is lack of
editor completion and mypy support - this requires the implementation of a mypy plugin, which is planned for the future.

Excluding Fields
----------------

You can exclude any field in the original model class from the :class:`DTO <starlite.dto.DTO>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/data_transfer_objects/dto_exclude_fields.py
    :caption: Excluding fields
    :language: python


The generated ``MyClassDTO`` is equal to this model declaration:

.. code-block:: python

   from pydantic import BaseModel


   class MyClassDTO(BaseModel):
       second: int


Remapping Fields
----------------

You can remap fields in two ways:


#. you can switch change their keys:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/data_transfer_objects/dto_remap_fields.py
    :caption: Remapping fields
    :language: python


The generated ``MyClassDTO`` is equal to this model declaration:

.. code-block:: python

   from pydantic import BaseModel


   class MyClassDTO(BaseModel):
       second: int
       third: int


You can remap name and type. To do this use a tuple instead of a string for the object value:


.. literalinclude:: /examples/data_transfer_objects/dto_remap_fields_with_types.py
    :caption: Remapping fields with types
    :language: python


The generated ``MyClassDTO`` is equal to this model declaration:

.. code-block:: python

   from pydantic import BaseModel


   class MyClassDTO(BaseModel):
       third: int
       fourth: float

Add New Fields
--------------

You add fields that do not exist in the original model by passing in a ``field_definitions`` dictionary. This dictionary
should have field names as keys, and a tuple following the format supported by the
`pydantic create_model helper <https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#dynamic-model-creation>`_:


- For required fields use a tuple of type + ellipsis, for example ``(str, ...)``.
- For optional fields use a tuple of type + ``None`` , for example ``(str, None)``
- To set a default value use a tuple of type + default value, for example ``(str, "Hello World")``

.. literalinclude:: /examples/data_transfer_objects/dto_add_new_fields.py
    :caption: Add new fields
    :language: python


The generated ``MyClassDTO`` is equal to this model declaration:

.. code-block:: python

   from pydantic import BaseModel


   class MyClassDTO(BaseModel):
       first: int
       second: int
       third: str

DTO Methods
-----------

DTO.from_model_instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you create a DTO class you can use its class method :meth:`from_model_instance <starlite.dto.DTO.from_model_instance>`
to create an instance from an existing instance of the model from which the DTO was generated:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/data_transfer_objects/dto_from_model_instance.py
    :caption: DTO.from_model_instance()
    :language: python


In the above, ``dto_instance`` is a validated pydantic model instance.

DTO.to_model_instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you have an instance of a :class:`DTO <starlite.dto.DTO>` model, you can convert it into a model instance using the
:meth:`to_model_instance <starlite.dto.DTO.to_model_instance>` method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/data_transfer_objects/dto_to_model_instance.py
    :caption: DTO.to_model_instance()
    :language: python


In the above ``company_instance`` is an instance of the SQLAlchemy declarative class ``Company``. It is correctly typed as
``Company`` because the :class:`DTO <starlite.dto.DTO>` class uses generic to store this data.

.. attention::

    If you exclude keys or add additional fields, you should make sure this does not cause an error when trying to
    generate a model class from a dto instance. For example, if you exclude required fields from a pydantic model and try
    to create an instance from a dto that doesn't have these, a validation error will be raised.

Automatic Conversion on Response
--------------------------------

When you use a DTO as a return type in a route handler, if the returned data is a model or a dict, it will be converted
to the DTO automatically:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/data_transfer_objects/dto_auto_conversion.py
    :caption: DTO automatic conversion
    :language: python


In the above, when requesting route of a company, the ``secret`` attribute will not be included in the response. And it
also works when returning a list of companies.



Creating partial DTOs
----------------------

Sometimes you may only need to partially modify a resource. In these cases, DTOs can be wrapped with
:class:`Partial <starlite.types.Partial>`.

.. code-block:: python

   from pydantic import BaseModel
   from starlite.types.partial import Partial


   class CompanyDTO(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       worth: float


   PartialCompanyDTO = Partial[CompanyDTO]

The created ``PartialCompanyDTO`` is equivalent to the following declaration:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import Optional
   from pydantic import BaseModel


   class PartialCompanyDTO(BaseModel):
       id: Optional[int]
       name: Optional[str]
       worth: Optional[float]

:class:`Partial <starlite.types.Partial>` can also be used inline when creating routes.

.. code-block:: python

   from pydantic import UUID4, BaseModel
   from starlite.controller import Controller
   from starlite.handlers import patch
   from starlite.types.partial import Partial


   class UserOrder(BaseModel):
       order_id: UUID4
       order_item_id: UUID4
       notes: str


   class UserOrderController(Controller):
       path = "/user"

       @patch(path="/{order_id:uuid}")
       async def update_user_order(
           self, order_id: UUID4, data: Partial[UserOrder]
       ) -> UserOrder:
           ...
